# to uncomment the following option and set your preffered keyid

default-key $DEFAULT_KEY

# GnuPG ultimately trusts all keys in the secret keyring.  If you do
# not have all your secret keys online available you should use this
# option to tell GnuPG about ultimately trusted keys.
# You have to give the long keyID here which can be obtained by using
# the --list-key command along with the option --with-colons; you will
# get a line similiar to this one:
#    pub:u:1024:17:5DE249965B0358A2:1999-03-15:2006-02-04:59:f:
# the 5th field is what you want.

trusted-key $TRUSTED_KEY

# The next option is enabled because this one is needed for interoperation
# with PGP 5 users.  To enable full OpenPGP compliance you have to remove
# this option.

force-v3-sigs

# Because some mailers change lines starting with \"From \" to \">From \"
# it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
# cleartext signatures; all other PGP versions do it this way too.
# To enable full OpenPGP compliance you have to remove this option.

escape-from-lines

# If you do not use the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) charset, you should
# tell GnuPG which is the native character set.  Please check
# the man page for supported character sets. 

charset iso-8859-1

# lock the file only once for the lifetime of a process.
# if you do not define this, the lock will be obtained and released
# every time it is needed - normally this is not needed.

lock-once

# GnuPG can send and receive keys to and from a keyserver.  These
# servers can be HKP, email, or LDAP (if GnuPG is built with LDAP
# support).
#
# Example HKP keyserver:
#      hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
#
# Example email keyserver:
#      mailto:pgp-public-keys@keys.pgp.net
#
# Example LDAP keyservers:
#      ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370
#      ldap://keyserver.pgp.com
#
# Regular URL syntax applies, and you can set an alternate port
# through the usual method:
#      hkp://keyserver.example.net:22742
#
# If you have problems connecting to a HKP server through a buggy http
# proxy, you can use keyserver option broken-http-proxy (see below),
# but first you should make sure that you have read the man page
# regarding proxies (keyserver option honor-http-proxy)
#
# Most users just set the name and type of their preferred keyserver.
# Note that most servers (with the notable exception of
# ldap://keyserver.pgp.com) synchronize changes with each other.  Note
# also that a single server name may actually point to multiple
# servers via DNS round-robin.  hkp://subkeys.pgp.net is an example of
# such a "server", which spreads the load over a number of physical
# servers.

keyserver ${KEY_SERV_ALL:-hkp://subkeys.pgp.net}
