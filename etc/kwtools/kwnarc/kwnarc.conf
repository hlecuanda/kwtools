## Config options
##

# Start Iptables at boot up?
START_IPTABLES="no"

# Load Netfilter modules - only necessary if you compiled netfilter as modules
LOAD_MODULES="yes"

# Network parameters
EXTERNAL_INTERFACE=""		# Example: "eth0"
DYNAMIC_EXTERNAL_IP="no"		# If this is set to "no", you'll need to enter an IP address below
EXTERNAL_INTERFACE_IP=""        # If DYNAMIC_EXTERNAL_IP is "yes", KWNARC will attempt to auto-obtain this
EXTERNAL_INTERFACE_IPV6=""
TEMP_ADDR="no"				# Set this to "yes" to enable ipv6 privacy addressing
TEMP_PREFERED_LFT="86400"	# default is 86400
TEMP_VALID_LFT="608400"		# default is 604800


# The options immediately below control server services that you're offering to the outside world - it does not limit
# the services available to your localhost.
# Use comma separated name or numeric value from /etc/services - if port is > 1024, use numeric value instead of name
#
# Note: limited to 15 services - you shouldn't need more than 15 ports open, especially on a firewall.
ALLOW_TCP_EXT=""                # Example "ssh,smtp,http" - note the lack of spaces

CHECK_SYN_PACKET_LENGTH="yes"   # Do not disable unless you must use a stock kernel that does not support length checking

#
# The options immediately below here are similar to above, except that they allows you to enter port ranges (and single ports)
# using space separated numeric values. Enter as many as necessary (i.e. not limited to 15 entries).
# Unless needed, use the above instead.

# MASQuerading section - This is the Linux equivalent of "Internet Connection Sharing"
# Don't turn on ALWAYS_FORWARD unless you know what you're doing.
# ALWAYS_FORWARD will keep forwarding (and masq'ing) traffic even when there are no firewall rules loaded.

LAN_INTERFACE=""		# Example: "eth1"
ALWAYS_FORWARD="no"		# Don't turn this on unless you want to forward traffic even when not firewalling.
PROTECT_FROM_LAN=""     # "yes" or "no" - Protect firewall from internal network

# The options immediately below control server services that you're offering to your internal LAN - it does not limit
# the services available to your localhost.
# Use comma separated name or numeric value from /etc/services - if port is > 1024, use numeric value instead of name
